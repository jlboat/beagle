## Use
This repository is not the primary location to access Beagle nor was it generated by anyone on the Beagle team. This was merely my own attempt to generate a project for the Beagle source code so it could be readily examined, modified and compiled.

For the official site, please see [here](https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle.html)

## Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlboat/beagle
cd beagle
mvn package
```
